# Lab 33 - Use RegEx to Search Text

### THURSDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to practice writing RegEx expressions, and learn to search for patterns within text. In this lab, you'll prompt the user for a URL, and then also a string (word or phrase). Your script will then parse the text on that URL for the user's string and return, "Found a match :)" or "No match :("

Before starting this code, read about the **re** module available in both Python 2.x and Python 3.x https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html

This code should run in Python 2.x

### Procedure

0. Take a moment to clean up your remote Desktop. For now, close all other terminal spaces or windows you might have open.

0. Open a new terminal, then change directories to **/home/student/bin**

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd ~/bin`
    
0. Launch the Leafpad editor.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `leafpad &`
    
0. Begin with a Python 2.x Shebang line.

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    ```
    
0. Great. Now add support for the urllib library.

    ```
    import urllib
    ```
    
0. Fantastic. Next add support for the RegEx library.

    ```
    import re
    ```
    
0. Skip a line to make the text for readable. On the next line, place the following statement.

    ```
    print 'Where should we search?'
    ```
    
0. Fantastic, now set **url** equal to **raw_input()**

    ```
    url = raw_input()
    ```

0. Ask the user what to search for, and print the URL for the user.

    ```
    print "Great! So we'll try to open this url " + str(url) + ' to search for the phrase:'
    ```

0. Now we want to collect input for what to search for.

    ```
    searchFor = raw_input()
    ```
    
0. Fantastic. Now let's use the urllib library to parse the url entered by the user.

    ```
    searchMe = urllib.urlopen(url).read()
    ```

0. This next line is an if statement with a conditional that reads as follows, "If searchFor pattern matches searchMe string". If you want to know more about using **re.search()** then read about the **re** module here: https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html

    ```
    if re.search(searchFor, searchMe):
    ```

0. The above function will return a matchObject, which tests True, so the above conditional will execute code under it on a match. For now, let's indent 4 whitespaces, and print a simple message.

    ```
        print 'Found a match :)'
    ```

0. Outside of the if statement, code the **else** statement.

    ```
    else:
    ```
    
0. Now indent 4 whitespaces, and print a no match message.

    ```
        print 'No match :('
    ```

0. Choose **File > Save** then name the file **http_parser.py** and place it in **/home/student/bin/**

0. Back at the terminal, update permissions.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `chmod u+x http_parser.py`

0. Run the program. If it runs, you should be able to enter a URL and a phrase to search on. Run a few positive and negative tests with the data provided below.

0. Project Gutenberg (http://www.gutenberg.org) has lots of free books available that are in the public domain (i.e. legally available). Run the script at least twice. We want a postiive, and negative result. A few suggestions are below.

    - Positive Test:
        - [**URL:**](https://alta3.com) `https://alta3.com`
        - **Phrase:** `Alta3`
        
    - Negative Test
        - [**URL:**](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345.txt) `http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/345/pg345.txt`
        - **Phrase:** `vegetarian`
        
    - Positive Test:
        - [**URL:**](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/98/98-0.txt) `http://www.gutenberg.org/files/98/98-0.txt`
        - **Phrase:** `It was the best of times`

    - Negative Test
        - [**URL:**](https://bing.com) `https://bing.com`
        - **Phrase:** `google it`  


0. The completed solution is shown below:

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import urllib
    import re

    print 'Where should we search?'
    url = raw_input()
    print "Great! So we'll try to open this url " + str(url) + 'to search for the phrase:'
    searchFor = raw_input()
    searchMe = urllib.urlopen(url).read()

    if re.search(searchFor, searchMe):
        print 'Found a match :)'
    else:
        print 'No match :('
    ```

0. At this point, you should have a little bit of experience with Wireshark. How about opening it up, starting a trace on the **any** interface, entering a display filter of **http**, and then executing your script. Don't forget to **stop** your trace, and close Wireshark when you're done. It can be a resource hog if left to run!

0. That's it for this lab! Two bonus objectives can be found below if you're looking for more objectives to complete. Be sure to let the instructor know if you solve any of them!

0. **Bonus Objective 01:** Make the program accept a number of strings from the user.

0. **Bonus Objective 02:** Return to the user how many matches appear on a page.

0. Solutions to the Bonus Objectives can be found on the [**SOLUTIONS**](https://alta3.com/python/33a/) page.

# Lab 27 - pip - Python Package Managment System
### WEDNESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
**pip** is the defacto tool for checking out python packages from PyPI - the Python Package Index, a respository for Python code. At the time of writing, there were about 114,150 packages available. It might not be a bad idea to check out the repository if you haven't before [PyPi - Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)

Clicking around you'll find community code, as well as descriptions of that code. In this example we'll explore using pip and how it can be useful for us within an SDN environment.

### Procedure

0. Open a new terminal session. See the screenshot below if you're lost.

0. Change to the */home/student/* directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd /home/student/`

0. Let's first uninstall pip and reinstall it just to see how easy it is.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo pip uninstall pip`

0. Great! it's gone. Now put it back.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo easy_install pip`
    
0. Start with a version check. This command should return some info about the version of pip you're running.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `pip --version`

0. Issue the command to explore **pip** help.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `pip help`
     
0. We can explore commands associated with the **pip install** command.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `pip help install`

0. Say we want to find a package. We can just do a **pip search <package name or keyword>**. Issue the pip search command on the word *game*.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `pip search game`
     
0. Great! At the bottom of the list you should see a Python package called **Zorky (2.0)**. Let's try installing it!

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo pip install zorky`
    
0. Here's another way to run the same command, but maximize the chance of it working. It's a bit more typing, but not much. This forces Python 2.x to execute the pip module, and will ensure the zorky code gets installed in the proper Python 2.x library. Let's run it *just to be safe*.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `sudo python -m pip install zorky`
     
0. The next question might be, how do we use **zorky (2.0)**? We can start at the Python Package Index website. Navigate to the website https://pypi.python.org/pypi in Firefox and then search for **zorky** in the upper right hand corner. If you're lost, see the screenshot below.

0. The result will be the **Zorky** usage page (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zorky/2.0). Here you can read about the code as well as the usage. Looks like the command to run the code is to type **import aliens**, and then **aliens.start()**. If you're lost, see the screenshot below.

    ![Zorky 2.0](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_pip_002.png)

0. Enter the Python 2.x environment by typing **python**.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `python`

0. Now within the python environment, type **import aliens**.

    `>>>` `import aliens`
     
0. Now launch the code with **aliens.start()**

    `>>>` `aliens.start()`

0. A fun little game launches as a result. You don't need to play it. Type **exit** to leave the game (and the Python environment).

    `>` `exit`

0. Let's use the **pip list** command to see what packages have been installed.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `pip list`
     
0. At the bottom of the list you can see **zorky (2.0)**. If you're lost, see the screenshot below.

    ![Zorky list](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_pip_003.png)

0. Let's go ahead and uninstall **zorky (2.0)**.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo pip uninstall zorky`

0. You'll be prompted to proceed. Type **Y** and **Enter**. If you're lost, see the screenshot below.

    ![Zorky uninstall](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_pip_004.png)

0. Let's use the **pip list** command to confirm that **zorky** has been uninstalled.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `pip list`
     
0. Notice that beside the packages are versions. Issue the **pip list -outdated** or **pip list -o** to see which Python packages can be updated.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `pip list -o`
     
0. It can be highly disruptive to upgrade Python packages that other applications are depending on, so in the name of stability, we won't issue the update command. However, you should know that we could issue *pip install -U <name of the package>* if we wanted to upgrade an outdated package.

0. Imagine you're working on a Python project and you have a coworker that says they want to help, or maybe you just want to recreate your current Python environment. The **pip freeze** command will print the packages and versions to the screen in a format that can be used for just that. Try issuing it.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `pip freeze`

0. Now try outputting the freeze command to a file called **example_requirements.txt**

    `student@beachhead:~$` `pip freeze > example_requirements.txt`

0. Even though all of these things are already installed, let's try using the **example_requirements.txt** file we just made.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `pip install -r example_requirments.txt`
     
0. Let's try installing a useful network package called **linux-nethelp**. Check out the Package Index page, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/linux-nethelp/1.0.1

0. The author of this package also has a homepage for the project, feel free to check it out https://github.com/haarcuba/linux-nethelp

0. On the homepage, you see that 

0. Use pip to install **linux-nethelp**. When installing on a system with both Python 2.x and 3.x, it is best to launch the pip module, specifying **python** or **python3**. This will ensure your code is install in the location your intend.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo python -m pip install linux-nethelp`

0. Launch the **python** environment.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `python`

0. Use the **from** and **import** command to bring in the new package to your current namespace.

    `>>>` `from linux_nethelp.scan_interfaces import ScanInterfaces`
    
0. Now use the **import** command to add the pprint module, which provides a capability to “pretty-print” arbitrary Python data structures in a form which can be used as input to the interpreter. 

    `>>>` `import pprint`

0. Create a list called **interfaces** from **ScanInterfaces()**

    `>>>` `interfaces = list( ScanInterfaces() )`
    
0. Finally, access the **pprint** namespace, and pass pprint the argument, **interfaces**.

    `>>>` `pprint.pprint( interfaces )`
    
0. Your output should look like the one below. 

    ![ScanInterfaces Output](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_pip_005.png)
    
0. You can imagine how in writing your own custom program, using the output produced by calling on the code contained within this package might be helpful. Afterall, why rewrite code if it's freely available? Type **exit()** to leave the python environment.

    `>>>` `exit()`

0. That's pretty much all there is to **pip**! Feel free to take some time and play around with the **pip** tool or exploring [PyPi - Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) before moving onto the next lab.

# Lab 25 - Using Python to Create an OpenStack Permissions File
### WEDNESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
OpenStack requires that users authenticate via a set of credentials. At the command line, these credentials are typically set via an *openRC* file. This file is a shell script that sets environmental variables local shell environment. 

OpenStack operators typically manage many OpenRC files, as each one corresponds to a different user with their own unique set of permissions. An OpenRC file is effectively a template with a customzied user name, password, and other identifying marks applied. Therefore, the objective of this lab is to use some basic Python programming skills to write a program that can rapidly output files to identify administractive users of an OpenStack cloud.

This program should run in Python 3.x

### Procedure

0. To begin, let's review what typically appears in an OpenStack openRC permission file.

    ```
    export OS_AUTH_URL=<url-to-openstack-identity>
    export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3
    export OS_PROJECT_NAME=<project-name>
    export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=<project-domain-name>
    export OS_USERNAME=<username>
    export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=<user-domain-name>
    export OS_PASSWORD=<password>  # (optional-- but we'll set it in ours)
    ```
    
0. Intially, we'll prompt the user for the values surrounded by angle brackets. Then we'll write out the file. Begin by opening a new terminal session.

0. Change directories to **/home/student/bin**.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd /home/student/bin`

0. Open the leafpad text editor

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `leafpad &`

0. At this point you have two options: the first is to follow along with the lab, the second is to try to write this program yourself. If you write it yourself and create a unique solution, then comment the code and submit it to the instructor. We'll add it to the list of possible solutions at the end of this lab (and give you credit).

0. So let's start with what's easy. This program should run in Python 3.x, so start with a proper shebang line.

    `#!/usr/bin/env python3`

0. Now open a file for writing to called **admin.rc**.

    `outFile = open('admin.rc', 'a')`

0. Prompt the user for the **OS_AUTH_URL**, and then write it to **admin.rc**. We'll use 3 lines to do this.

    ```
    print('What is the OS_AUTH_URL?')
    osAUTH = input()
    print('export OS_AUTH_URL=' + osAUTH, file=outFile)
    ```

0. Write **OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3** out to **admin.rc**

    `print('export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3', file=outFile)`

0. Prompt the user for the **OS_PROJECT_NAME**, and then write it to **admin.rc**

    ```
    print('What is the OS_PROJECT_NAME?')
    osPROJ = input()
    print('export OS_PROJECT_NAME=' + osPROJ, file=outFile)
    ```

0. Prompt the user for the **OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME**

    ```
    print('What is the OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME?')
    osPROJDOM = input()
    print('export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=' + osPROJDOM, file=outFile)
    ```

0. Prompt the user for the **OS_USERNAME**

    ```
    print('What is the OS_USERNAME?')
    osUSER = input()
    print('export OS_USERNAME=' + osUSER, file=outFile)
    ```

0. Prompt the user for the **OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME**

    ```
    print('What is the OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME?')
    osUSERDOM = input()
    print('export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=' + osUSERDOM, file=outFile)
    ```

0. Prompt the user for the **OS_PASSWORD**

    ```
    print('What is the OS_PASSWORD?')
    osPASS = input()
    print('export OS_PASSWORD=' + osPASS, file=outFile)
    ```

0. Close the file **admin.rc**

    ```
    outFile.close()
    ```

0. If you're following along, your solution should now look like this:

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    outFile = open('admin.rc', 'a')
    print('What is the OS_AUTH_URL?')
    osAUTH = input()
    print('export OS_AUTH_URL=' + osAUTH, file=outFile)
    print('export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3', file=outFile)
    print('What is the OS_PROJECT_NAME?')
    osPROJ = input()
    print('export OS_PROJECT_NAME=' + osPROJ, file=outFile)
    print('What is the OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME?')
    osPROJDOM = input()
    print('export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=' + osPROJDOM, file=outFile)
    print('What is the OS_USERNAME?')
    osUSER = input()
    print('export OS_USERNAME=' + osUSER, file=outFile)
    print('What is the OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME?')
    osUSERDOM = input()
    print('export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=' + osUSERDOM, file=outFile)
    print('What is the OS_PASSWORD?')
    osPASS = input()
    print('export OS_PASSWORD=' + osPASS, file=outFile)
    outFile.close()
    ```

0. Save your program as **/home/student/bin/openstack.py**

0. Back at the terminal session, change the permissions on **openstack.py**

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `chmod u+x openstack.py`

0. Run **openstack.py** and use the following information:

    - http://controller:35357/v2/
    - myproject
    - default
    - admin
    - default
    - alta3
    
0. Print the contents of **admin.rc** to the screen. It should look similar to the output below:

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `cat admin.rc`

    ```
    export OS_AUTH_URL=http://controller:35357/v2/
    export OS_PROJECT_NAME=myproject
    export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    export OS_USERNAME=admin
    export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=default
    export OS_PASSWORD=alta3
    ```

0. Suppose we have an Excel spreadsheet with a list of OpenStack user credentials. They're new customers, and they want to use the cloud starting Monday morning, so the boss *needs* us to make **500 unique admin.rc files**. Life is on hold until the work is done. Let's see if we can't get a fast victory with Python.

0. Download the CSV user data (Excel stores data as CSV records). This CSV file only has **26** users in it, but we'll consider this part of the exercise a success, if we can get the 26 files made!

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `wget -O /home/student/bin/csv_users.txt "https://alta3.com/static/images/python/csv_users.txt"`

0. Take a peek at what you just downloaded. Print the data to the screen.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `cat csv_users.txt`

0. CSV data is perfectly suited for reading into lists. Lists are perfectly suited for iterating in loops. Let's see if we can write a program that reads the data in **csv_users.txt**, and use it to produce 26 seperate **admin.rc** files. At this point, you're welcome to work on your own, or follow along. The solution will be printed at the end of the lab. Of course, if you make your own unique soltuion, let the instructor know and we'll add it to this lab.

0. Launch a new leafpad session

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `leafpad &`
    
0. Begin with a Python3 shebang

    `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
    
0. Now import the csv library, for more on how it works, check out this link https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html

    `import csv`
    
0. Make **f** a file object, by reading **csv_users.txt**

    `f = open('csv_users.txt', 'r')`
    
0. Set **i** equal to 0. We're going to use this as a counter.

    `i = 0`
    
0. Now we want to use the **csv.reader()** This function will read each line of the file in row. Row becomes a list, where each comma seperated value becomes a new value in that list.

    `for row in csv.reader(f):`
    
0. Let's increment i by 1. This will appear at the end of our admin.rc file. Don't forget to indent 4 spaces.

    `    i = i + 1`
    
0. Now set filename equal to **admin.rc%d**. %d is a place holder for a digit, where the digit we want to apply is the value of i found at the end of this line of code. Don't forget to indent 4 spaces.

    `    filename = 'admin.rc%d'%(i,)`
    
0. Now make **rcfile** the open file object, **filename**, so we can write to it. Don't forget to indent 4 spaces.

    `    rcfile = open(filename, 'w')`
    
0. Now write the value of **OS_AUTH_URL** to **rcfile**. We also want to write the value of **row[0]** which is the first value in the first row of **csv_users.txt**. Don't forget to indent 4 spaces.

    `    print('export OS_AUTH_URL=' + row[0], file=rcfile)`
    
0. Now just write the value of OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3 to **rcfile**. Don't forget to indent 4 spaces.

    `    print('export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3', file=rcfile)`
    
0. Now write the value of **OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME** to **rcfile**. We also want to write the value of **row[1]** which is the second value within a row of **csv_users.txt**. Don't forget to indent 4 spaces.

    `    print('export OS_PROJECT_NAME=' + row[1], file=rcfile)`
    
0. Now write the value of **OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME** to **rcfile**. We also want to write the value of **row[2]** which is the third value within a row of **csv_users.txt**. Don't forget to indent 4 spaces.

    `    print('export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=' + row[2], file=rcfile)`
    
0. Now write the value of **OS_USERNAME** to **rcfile**. We also want to write the value of **row[3]** which is the fourth value within a row of **csv_users.txt**. Don't forget to indent 4 spaces.

    `    print('export OS_USERNAME=' + row[3], file=rcfile)`
    
0. Now write the value of **OS_USERNAME_DOMAIN_NAME** to **rcfile**. We also want to write the value of **row[4]** which is the fifth value within a row of **csv_users.txt**. Don't forget to indent 4 spaces.

    `        print('export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=' + row[4], file=rcfile)`
    
0. Now write the value of **OS_PASSWORD** to **rcfile**. We also want to write the value of **row[5]** which is the sixth value within a row of **csv_users.txt**. Don't forget to indent 4 spaces.

    `    print('export OS_PASSWORD=' + row[5], file=rcfile)`
    
0. Now close the **rcfile**, as we've completed our first file. Memory will thank you, and the loop will repeat.

    `    rcfile.close()`
    
0. At this time your code should look like the one below.

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    import csv
    f = open('csv_users.txt', 'r')
    i = 0
    for row in csv.reader(f):
        i = i + 1
        filename = 'admin.rc%d'%(i,)
        rcfile = open(filename, 'w')
        print('export OS_AUTH_URL=' + row[0], file=rcfile)
        print('export OS_IDENTITY_API_VERSION=3', file=rcfile)
        print('export OS_PROJECT_NAME=' + row[1], file=rcfile)
        print('export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME=' + row[2], file=rcfile)
        print('export OS_USERNAME=' + row[3], file=rcfile)
        print('export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME=' + row[4], file=rcfile)
        print('export OS_PASSWORD=' + row[5], file=rcfile)
        rcfile.close()
    ```

0. Save your code as **rclooper.py** in **/home/student/bin**

0. Back at the terminal, change permissions on your file so it may be executed.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `chmod u+x rclooper.py`
    
0. Great! Now try executing your script.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `./rclooper.py`

0. If it worked, you should now have **26** admin.rc files. Type **ls** to list all files in the **/home/student/bin** directory.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `ls`

0. Try printing one to the screen.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `cat admin.rc1`

0. Cat a few more out to the screen. Ensure a few of them match the data that was provided in **csv_users.txt**

0. Good job! That's it for this lab. If you'd like another task to accomplish, combining both of our code blocks into definitions that are callable via input by the user when the program runs. Maybe the user presses 1 to manually create a file, and presses 2, to have **csv_users.txt** read and turned into admin.rc files. If you do improve the code we just wrote, be sure to let the instructor know, so we can show off your code below.

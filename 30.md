# Lab 30 - RESTful Interfaces with Python and etcd

### THURSDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

Our objective is to explore RESTful API interfaces with Python. REST stands for Representational State Transfer (it is sometimes spelled "ReST"). It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol -- and in virtually all cases, the HTTP protocol is used. REST is an architecture style for designing networked applications.

In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building application software. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer.

In this lab we'll use **etcd** 

### Procedure

0. Take a moment to clean up your remote Desktop. For now, close all other terminal spaces or windows you might have open.

0. Open a new terminal, then *cd* to the home student directory

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`

0. Let's first install **etcd** on the student beachhead machine 

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo apt install etcd`
    
0. Ensure that **etcd** is running on the student beachhead machine.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo service etcd status`

0. Now let's test the **etcd** api with the curl command. First we'll try getting the **etcd** version.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `curl -L http://127.0.0.1:2379/version`

0. Now let's place a key-value pair in **etcd**. 

    `student@beachhead:~$` `curl http://127.0.0.1:2379/v2/keys/message -XPUT -d value="Hello world"`

0. Try getting a key-value pair.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `curl http://127.0.0.1:2379/v2/keys/message`

0. Now let's remove the key-value pair.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `curl http://127.0.0.1:2379/v2/keys/message -XDELETE`

0. So we just deleted the key-value pair, and now we'll try to retrieve it. This should produce an error ***errorCode:100** message error expected*

    `student@beachhead:~$` `curl http://127.0.0.1:2379/v2/keys/message`
    
0. All right, so we've explored RESTful states. Now let's play with **Insomnia REST client**. Insomnia is a desktop app that lets us explore, test-out, and consume REST apis.

0. Start Insominia by clicking the **Red "3" in Lower Left of Screen > Programming > Insomnia** If you're lost, see the screenshot below.

    ![Launch Insomnia](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_rest_001.png)


0. If a new version alert pops-up, click **Later**

0. The Insomnia application should launch. Let's create a new request. Click "New Request" within the app. If you're lost, see the screenshot below.

    ![Insomnia](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_rest_002.png)
    
0. In the pop-up, write "etcd version", then click the **Create** button

0. At the top of the screen, beside the **GET** dropdown, place our REST URI, **http://127.0.0.1:2379/version**. If you're lost, see the screenshot below.

    ![Send GET](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_rest_004.png)

0. Now click the **Send** button. This will generate at HTTP message, targeted at our RESTful URI.

    ![Click Send](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_rest_005.png)

0. Notice that Insomnia 'pretty printed' the response that was embedded within the 200 HTTP message that was returned to our HTTP GET request.

0. Let's create a new request. On the left hand side press the tiny **+** (plus sign) within a circle. Then click **New Request** in the resulting dropdown. If you're lost, see the screenshot below.

    ![Insomnia New Request](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_rest_006.png)

0. In the resulting pop-up, name the new request **new key-value pair**, then click **Create**

0. At the top of the screen, use the dropdown to change **GET** to **PUT**. The new REST URI to use is **http://127.0.0.1:2379/v2/keys/sleepy**. If you're lost, see the screenshot below.

    ![Insomnia Sleepy](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_rest_007.png)

0. Now click the **Query Tab**

0. Below **URL Preview** place the word **value** in the name column, and **"sleepy time** in the value column. If you're lost, see the screenshot below.

    ![Insomnia Query](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_rest_008.png)
    
0. Now click the **Send** button at the top of the screen.

0. Let's take a moment to evaluate the response. The response is shown in the screenshot below. 

    ![Key Value Response](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_rest_008.png)
    
0. Let's create a new request. On the left hand side, hover over the rule **new key-value pair** then press the tiny down arrow. In the resulting dropdown, select **Duplicate**. If you're lost, see the screenshot below.

    ![Duplicate](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_rest_009.png)

0. A copy will appear below the current rule. Double click the rule to rename it.

0. Rename the new request **fetch key-value pair**, then click **Create**

0. At the top of the screen, modify the request type to **GET**. If you're lost, see the screenshot below.

    ![Change to GET](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_rest_011.png)

0. Press the **Send** button to send our *HTTP GET* request to *etcd*.

0. The response is the same as what was *PUT* to *etcd*. 

0. Again, let's create a new request. On the left hand side, hover over the rule **fetch key-value pair**, then press the tiny down arrow. In the resulting dropdown, select **Duplicate**.

0. Click on the new rule's tiny down arrow, then select **Settings**

0. In the new pop-up, make the new rule's name **delete key-value pair**. When done, press **Save**.

0. Click on the new rule **delete key-value pair** and at the top of the screen, modify the dropdown request type to **DELETE**. If you're lost, see the screenshot below.

    ![Change to DELETE](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_rest_012.png)

0. Press the **Send** button. The results are shown below.

    ![DELETE Result](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_rest_013.png)

0. Click on the rule we made called, **GET fetch key-value pair**

0. Click **Send** on this rule. We wouldn't expect it to work since we removed the key-value pair. You should get a 404 error in response.
  
    ![404 Result](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_rest_014.png)  
  
0. What we're finding is that Insomnia is an easier to use version of *curl*, however, it can be useful in generating *curl* commands and URLs that we might need for our own custom Python scripts. **Click the tiny down arrow** on any of the requests we created on the right, then select **Generate Code**. If you're lost, see the screenshot below.

    ![404 Result](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_rest_015.png)

0. So here's the curl command that we could utilize at the commandline, as well as a properly formatted URL we might want to use in a Python script. 

    ![404 Result](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_rest_016.png)

0. Press done on the **Generate Client Code** screen, and then minimize Insomnia. Let's use what we're learning to write some Python scripts.

0. Look at the Python Project Page on **requests**. http://docs.python-requests.org/ In reading, you'll find it's a *'Non-GMO grass-fed HTTP library safe for human consumption'*. Clearly, the designers had some fun. Know that it will allow us to easily produce HTTP message with Python.

0. In your open terminal session, change directory to **/home/student/bin**

    `student@beachhead:~$` `cd ~/bin`

0. The **requests** package is already installed, but it won't hurt to issue the pip command to install it (found on the documentation page https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests)

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo python3 -m pip install requests`

0. Launch the Python 3.x environment.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `python3`

0. We'll issue the following commands, one at a time, and discuss them as we proceed. The first command imports the requests package.

    `>>>` `import requests`
    
0. The next command produces an HTTP GET message to the URI 127.0.0.1:2379/version.

    `>>>` `r = requests.get("http://127.0.0.1:2379/version")`
    
0. Great! Now we have an HTTP response called object **r**. We can get all the information we need from this object.

    `>>>` `r`

0. Return the status code.

    `>>>` `r.status_code`
    
0. Return the value associated with the key (header) *content-type*.

    `>>>` `r.headers['content-type']`

0. Return the payload information (text), which is a JSON string.

    `>>>` `r.text`

0. There's a built in JSON decoder we can use too! Let's try decoding the JSON from **r**. It's only a tad bit different, but it should produce easier to read JSON.

    `>>>` `r.json()`
    
0. Exit the current Python3 environment.

    `>>>` `exit()`
 
0. Let's try this again, but this time, we'll create a new key-pair, and PUT it to **etcd** using Python. We're going to need pretty-print for this task, so let's make sure it is installed.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `sudo python3 -m pip install pprint`

0. Let's write a script based on what we just learned. Launch **leafpad**

    `student@beachhead:~$` `leafpad&`

0. Read the code below, along with the comments. Then copy and paste it into leafpad.

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    import requests, pprint # import requests and pretty print
    # the line below will store a PUT transaction with the key requests, the value http for humans, and the response, as the object r
    r = requests.put("http://127.0.0.1:2379/v2/keys/requests", data={'value': 'http for humans'})
    r.status_code # return the status code associated with object r
    pprint.pprint(r.json()) # pretty print the json associated with object r
    print('*******************')
    r = requests.put("http://127.0.0.1:2379/v2/keys/requests", data={'value': 'http for humans, version 2'})
    r.status_code
    pprint.pprint(r.json())
    print('*******************')
    r = requests.get("http://127.0.0.1:2379/v2/keys/requests")
    r.status_code
    pprint.pprint(r.json())
    ```

0. Choose **File > Save As** and save the file as **api_tester.py** in the **/home/student/bin/** folder.

0. Modify your code so that it runs.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `chmod u+x api_tester.py`

0. Now run your code.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `./api_tester.py`
    
0. Cool! So the top two blocks placed a key in the etcd keystore, where the last one performed a GET on our key.

0. Try modifying what is PUT to the etcd keystore. Also, try modifying the key, or using 'fancy URLs' containing many key-value pairs created by Insomnia.

0. That's it for this lab! Hopefully, with the help of Python and etcd, how APIs work is becoming more clear.

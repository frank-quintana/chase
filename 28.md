# Lab 28 - Using Python to get at your Network Interfaces

### WEDNESDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to demonstrate how to search for software on the Python Package Index, become comfortable working with pip, and write a simple program utilizing a package called netifaces. Before we get started, check it out on The Python Package Index. This is a repo of free code we can 'borrow' from: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/netifaces

### Procedure

0. Open a new terminal, and move to our directory for crafting scripts.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `cd /home/student/bin`

0. This next step maybe isn't ultra critical, because we're going to run **pip** as a module, but make sure that **pip3** is installed. This is a Linux command that will install it from the aptitude software repository (which is accessable to our OS, Ubuntu). Point being, this isn't really a Python command, but it installs a Python tool. Also, we didn't need to be in any special directory to run this command. It just worked out that we happened to be in **/home/student/bin**

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `sudo apt-get install python3-pip`

0. So as it turns out, when you have multiple versions of Python installed, it's 'easier' to run pip as a module, and assocaite it with the version of Python you're using. For example, here we're going to use Python3.x to run the code module called pip. Say **Y** to any questions.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `python3 -m pip install netifaces`

0. If we get a warning about upgrading pip, that's okay. The bigger deal is that **netifaces** installed. Start leafpad text editor.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `leafpad&`

0. Start with a Python 3.x shebang line.

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    ```
    
0. Great! Now let's import our new code.

    ```
    import netifaces
    ```

0. Now let's place a call to **netifaces.interfaces()** inside of **print()** and see what happens.

    ```
    print(netifaces.interfaces())
    ```

0. Choose **File > Save As** and save the file as **interface_reader.py** within **/home/student/bin/**

0. Down in the terminal, change permissions on your file.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `chmod u+x interface_reader.py`

0. Run your code.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `./interface_reader.py`

0. Okay, looks like it returns a list of our interfaces. Let's go back to our code, and add to it. Let's create a **for** loop, and iterate over **netifaces.interfaces()**

    ```
    for i in netifaces.interfaces():
    ```

0. Now indent 4 whitespaces, and let's print a line that presents our interface. Notice that **i** will take the name of one of the interfaces from within our list.

    ```
        print('\n**************Details of Interface - ' + i + ' *********************')
    ```

0. Now let's indent 4 whitespace, and try printing the details of the interface we're checking out.

    ```
        print(netifaces.ifaddresses(i))
    ```

0. Choose **File > Save**

0. Back at the terminal, run your code.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `./interface_reader.py`

0. Looks kind of ugly, as it starts with a dictionary value (these are a Linux system dependancy thing, and might be useful in super limited situations). Let's modify what is being presented (i.e. get rid of them). We figured out how to do this by reading the documentation page associated with **netifaces**. Change the line **print(netifaces.ifaddresses(i))** to the following:

    ```
        print(netifaces.ifaddresses(i)[netifaces.AF_LINK])
    ```

0. Choose **File > Save**

0. Back at the terminal, run your code.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `./interface_reader.py`
    
0. So it looks like we're being given a list, containing a single item, which is a dictionary, with two values. The first is **broadcast** and the second is **addr**. The boradcast is a bit boring, but that **addr** is the MAC address. Let's See if we can tweak our line to return what we're looking for. The following upgrade says we want that single item, and the value associate with the key **addr**.

    ```
        print(netifaces.ifaddresses(i)[netifaces.AF_LINK][0]['addr'])
    ```
    
0. Choose **File > Save**

0. Back at the terminal, run your code.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `./interface_reader.py`

0. Awesome! You should be seeing a single MAC address. Too cool. The documentation says we can change **IF_INET** to **AF_LINK**, and then we'll  get an IP address as well. Let's shoot from the hip, and copy our line of code, paste it below the current line, and tweak it to **AF_INET**.

    ```
        print(netifaces.ifaddresses(i)[netifaces.AF_INET][0]['addr'])
    ```

0. Choose **File > Save**

0. Back at the terminal, run your code.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `./interface_reader.py`

0. Okay, it blew up, but look at what it did BEFORE it blew up. It actually worked. It's just this **ovs-system** that is giving us a KeyError. Let's fix that. To review, your code should currently look like the following:

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    import netifaces

    print(netifaces.interfaces())

    for i in netifaces.interfaces():
        print('\n********Details of Interface - ' + i + ' ************')
        print((netifaces.ifaddresses(i)[netifaces.AF_LINK])[0]['addr']) # Prints the MAC address
        print((netifaces.ifaddresses(i)[netifaces.AF_INET])[0]['addr']) # Prints the IP address
    ```
    
0. Below the line that prints 'Details of interface - ', place a **try:** statement. Then indent all of the code below it by 4 spaces as shown below.

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    import netifaces

    print(netifaces.interfaces())

    for i in netifaces.interfaces():
        print('\n********Details of Interface - ' + i + ' ************')
        try:    # This is a new line, you also need to indent the code below this line by 4 whitespaces
            print((netifaces.ifaddresses(i)[netifaces.AF_LINK])[0]['addr']) # Prints the MAC address
            print((netifaces.ifaddresses(i)[netifaces.AF_INET])[0]['addr']) # Prints the IP address
    ```

0. We should have an **except:** line below the code we *hope* executes, where we print an error message if we can't display adapter info. Modify your code to look like the code below. We'll also print an error message.

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    import netifaces

    print(netifaces.interfaces())

    for i in netifaces.interfaces():
        print('\n********Details of Interface - ' + i + ' ************')
        try: 
            print((netifaces.ifaddresses(i)[netifaces.AF_LINK])[0]['addr']) # Prints the MAC address
            print((netifaces.ifaddresses(i)[netifaces.AF_INET])[0]['addr']) # Prints the IP address
        except:          # This is a new line
            print('Could not collect adapter information') # Print an error message
    ```
    
0. Okay. Great. Let's try to execute our code and see what happens. Choose **File > Save**

0. Back at the terminal, run your code.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `./interface_reader.py`
    
0. Wow. That was cool. It did exactly what we wanted too. Modify the code so that the MAC and IP address are labeled.

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    import netifaces

    print(netifaces.interfaces())

    for i in netifaces.interfaces():
        print('\n****** details of interface - ' + i + ' ******')
        try: 
            print('MAC: ', end='') # This print statement will always print MAC without an end of line
            print((netifaces.ifaddresses(i)[netifaces.AF_LINK])[0]['addr']) # Prints the MAC address
            print('IP: ', end='')  # This print statement will always print IP without an end of line
            print((netifaces.ifaddresses(i)[netifaces.AF_INET])[0]['addr']) # Prints the IP address
        except:          # This is a new line
            print('Could not collect adapter information') # Print an error message
    ```

0. That's it for this lab! Feel free to keep working, or if you're looking for more of a challenge, read on to the next step.

0. **Bonus Objective 01:** Create a function that returns just the **IP** address when passed an adapter name.

0. **Bonus Objecitve 02:** Create a function that returns just the **MAC** address when passed an adapter name.

0. **Bonus Objective 03:** Look at the day 1 labs, and try creating a program that performs 'some kind' of Network Function Virtualization. This article on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/89228/calling-an-external-command-in-python), along with the code you just learned to write in this lab, will be helpful.

### STUDENT SOLUTION 01 - October 4, 2017
Below is a custom solution created by a student on October 4, 2017. This code returns a letter grade and words of *'encouragement'* when the user inputs a score (percentage). Good job, Carlos!

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env python3
#Carlos Tapia 
#October 4, 2017
#This programs utilizes nested If statements that checks a grade entered by a user determines what letter grade it is

#Ask user to input their grade and save it grade variable
grade = int(input('Enter a grade and I will tell you letter grade\n'))

#If/Else loop that checks the grade value and determines which letter it is
if (grade > 100):
    print('Overachiever you made higher than 100, it\'s still an A')
elif ((grade <= 100) & (grade >= 90)):
    print('You made an A, you rock!')
elif ((grade <= 89) & (grade >= 80)):
    print('You made an B, keep it up you\'re close to an A')
elif ((grade <= 79) & (grade >= 70)):
    print('You made an C, a little more studying please')
elif ((grade <= 69) & (grade >= 60)):
    print('You made an D, bro you need to study more')
else:
    print('You made an F, you\'re a FAILURE')
</pre>


### STUDENT SOLUTION 02 - October 4, 2017
Below is a custom solution, created by a student on October 4, 2017. This code grades the strength of a Hurricane's wind speed, and returns its Category (1 through 5). Due to the overwhelming fanfare associated with getting your code placed in the Alta3 Lab Solutions page, this student asked to remain anonymous. Still, awesome program!

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env python

# Program to return the Safir-Simpson Hurricane Scale based on sustained 
#  wind speeds.

try:
    sus_wind = int(input("Please enter the sustained wind speed in mph: "))
    if(sus_wind < 0):
        print("Wind speed must be greater than zero")
        quit()


except:
    print("Invalid Entry!")
    quit()

if sus_wind >= 157:
    warning = "Cat5 - Evacuation Mandatory\n"

elif sus_wind < 157 and sus_wind >= 130:
    warning = "Cat4 - Evacuation Mandatory\n"

elif sus_wind < 130 and sus_wind >= 111:
    warning = "Cat3 - Evacuation Recommended\n"

elif sus_wind < 111 and sus_wind >= 96:
    warning = "Cat2 - Evacuation Optional\n"

elif sus_wind < 96 and sus_wind >= 74:
    warning = "Cat1 - Evacuation Optional\n"

else:
    warning = "Tropical Storm/Depression - No Evacaution\n"


print(warning)
</pre>

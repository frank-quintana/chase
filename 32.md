# Lab 32 - Use RegEx to Check Your External IP Address

### THURSDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
This is a simple Python script to check which external IP address you have. In this lab, we'll be using the urllib and re modules.

The code should run in Python 2.x

### Procedure

0. Take a moment to clean up your remote Desktop. For now, close all other terminal spaces or windows you might have open.

0. Open Firefox from *within* the remote Desktop. Sometimes it takes a moment to open, so be patient.

0. From within Firefox, navigate to *http://checkip.dyndns.org/*

0. A simple page should open that says something like, **Current IP Address: 71.251.147.238**. The actual IP address isn't as important, as is studying the way the text is formatted. Soon, your job is going to be to write a RegEx string that matches on the IP address.

0. Close the firefox window that you just opened within your remote desktop session.

0. Open a new terminal, then change directories to **/home/student/bin**

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd ~/bin`
    
0. In this lab, we'll be using the local host file to resolve beachhead. Take a peek at it.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `sudo cat /etc/hosts`

0. Ensure the first line looks like the following:

    ```
    127.0.0.1 localhost beachead
    ```
    
0. If the host file doesn't mention beachhead, edit the file (`sudo vim /etc/hosts`) and add beachhead so it can be resolved.

0. If things are working properly, the following command should work:

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `ping -c 1 beachhead`

0. If the ping above does not work, see the instructor. This script will not work if we cannot properly resolve our hostname.

0. Launch the leafpad editor and begin editting a file we save as `ipchecker.py`.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `leafpad &`
    
0. Let's write this program together. At the end, we'll give you some suggestions on how to improve the script. Start by declaring a Python 2.x shebang line.

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    ```

0. Now import the urllib library.

    ```
    import urllib
    ```

0. Now import the re library to assist us with RegEx.

    ```
    import re
    ```
    
0. Let's define a function called **get_external_ip()**

    ```
    def get_external_ip():
    ```
    
0. Indent four spaces, and define the variable **url** as **http://checkip.dyndns.org**

    ```
        url = 'http://checkip.dyndns.org'
    ```
    
0. Again, indent four spaces, and write the following. This code will open our url with **urllib.urlopen(url)**, we'll then read the contents of that URL and set the value of it to request.

    ```
        request = urllib.urlopen(url).read()
    ```

0. Now we'll use the **findall** function from the **re** module. The **findall** function, returns all non-overlapping matches of pattern in string, as a list of strings. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found. If one or more groups are present in the pattern, return a list of groups; this will be a list of tuples if the pattern has more than one group. Empty matches are included in the result unless they touch the beginning of another match. We'll use this to match on the IP address. Once again, indent four spaces.

    ```
        externalIP = re.findall('\d{1,3}.\d{1,3}.\d{1,3}.\d{1,3}', request)
    ```
    
0. This is the end of our function, so one last time, intent four spaces, then write the following:

    ```
        return externalIP
    ```
    
0. At the bottom of our code, write a statement to print some text to the screen, and then call our function:

    ```
    print('Your public IP address is: ' + str(get_external_ip()) )
    ```
    
0. At this point, save your file as **ipchecker.py** to **/home/student/bin**

0. At the command line, type the following to change permission on your saved python script.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `chmod u+x ipchecker.py`

0. Great. Now run your script! It should return your IP address to the screen.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `./ipchecker.py`

0. Below is the current solution, so far.

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python

    import urllib
    import re

    def get_external_ip():
        url = 'http://checkip.dyndns.org'
        request = urllib.urlopen(url).read()
        externalIP = re.findall('\d{1,3}.\d{1,3}.\d{1,3}.\d{1,3}', request)
        return externalIP

    print('Your public IP address is: ' + str(get_external_ip()) )
    ```

0. See if you can make the program **also** return your local IP address. The following code snippet was written by Smerlin (https://stackoverflow.com/users/231717/smerlin). This code contains two import statements, 

    ```
    import os
    import socket

    if os.name != "nt":
        import fcntl
        import struct

        def get_interface_ip(ifname):
            s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
            return socket.inet_ntoa(fcntl.ioctl(s.fileno(), 0x8915, struct.pack('256s', ifname[:15]))[20:24])

    def get_lan_ip():
        ip = socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())
        if ip.startswith("127.") and os.name != "nt":
            interfaces = [
                "eth0",
                "eth1",
                "eth2",
                "wlan0",
                "wlan1",
                "wifi0",
                "ath0",
                "ath1",
                "ppp0",
                ]
            for ifname in interfaces:
                try:
                    ip = get_interface_ip(ifname)
                    break
                except IOError:
                    pass
        return ip
    ```

    >**Hint:** in a terminal, if you enter `ip l` you will see a more detailed version of this:  
    >1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue  
    >2: **ens3**: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1450 q  
    >3: **ens4**: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc noop st  
    >are any of these interface names in the `interfaces = [` list above?  

0. Once you've combined Smerlin's code with your previous code, run it, and see that it works. You'll need to make a call to **get_lan_IP()**, which should return your local IP address. Use that in a print statement to display your local IP after your public IP. If it doesn't try again. And maybe again. If you get stuck, don't be afraid to ask the instructor for a little help.

0. Great job! That's it for this lab.

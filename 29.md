# Lab 29 - JSON to YAML Converter, Wireshark, and SIP
### THURSDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective
It is important to understand the fluidity of data structures. In this lab, we'll transmute JSON into a a YAML data structure. To drive home the importance of working with data structures, and to tie into networking concepts, we'll be taking our JSON data from Wireshark \*.pcap trace files.

The files we are working with in this lab are from an IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) lab. An IMS is what every modern telecom on the planet has servicing all of their business and residential phones. At this point, it's not just phones; it's cars, smart-fridges, home automation, solar panels, and so on. Pretty much every core cellular service, and many over-the-top apps, communicate to the IMS, and the protocol is almost always the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). You'll see SIP in the traces within this lab, as the capture is of two cellphones making a call.

The code should run in Python 2.x

### Procedure

0. Take a moment to clean up your Remote Desktop. For now, close all other terminal spaces or windows you might have open.

0. Open a new terminal, then *cd ~/bin* to the */home/student/bin* directory

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd ~/bin`
    
0. Launch the leafpad editor.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `leafpad &`

0. We're going to build this program line-by-line. The completed solution appears at the end. As you work on this project, save this first program as **/home/student/jso2yam.py**. If you'd like to make this lab more challenging, then try to code your own unique solution.

0. On the first line, define your Python shebang.

    `#!/usr/bin/env python`

0. On the second line, import the json library.

    `import json`
    
0. To understand how the JSON coder / decoder works within the Python standard library, visit the following page https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/json.html

0. On the third line, import the PyYAML library. Documentation can be found on the following page: http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML

    `import yaml`
    
0. Skip a line, then on the next step copy and paste in the following value for **sample**.

    ```
    sample = {
      "foo": "bar",
      "baz": [
        "qux",
        "quxx"
      ],
      "corge": None,
      "grault": 1,
      "garply": True,
      "waldo": "false",
      "fred": "undefined",
      "emptyArray": [],
      "emptyObject": {},
      "emptyString": ""
    }
    ```

0. Skip a line, and then print the following:

    `print 'Show me JSON:'`

0. The json library can parse JSON from strings or files. The library changes JSON into a Python dictionary or list. It can also convert Python dictionaries or lists into JSON strings. **json.dumps()** (dump string) is used to serialize objects to a JSON formatted string. This is typically used if we need to perform printing, parsing, or whatever. Skip a line, then write the following line:

    `print json.dumps(sample)`
    
0. Skip a line, just to make our code more readable.

0. Open a file called **data.yml** for writing to. The 'wb' here does nothing on Linux or Macs, but in Windows environment, this instructs the file to be opened in binary mode. Windows makes a distinction between text and binary files (handling of end-of-line characters, for example).

    `ff = open('data.yml', 'wb')`

0. Now use **yaml.dump()**, and the sample data, to our opened file **ff**. Setting *default_flow_style=False* sets collections to be serialized in the block style. 

    `yaml.dump(sample, ff, default_flow_style=False)`

0. Print out a line describing the YAML file that will follow:

    `print 'Show me YAML:'`

0. And now use yaml.dump() to print to the screen.

    `print yaml.dump(sample, default_flow_style=False)`

0. This lab isn't over, but at this time, your working code should look like the code below.

    **CURRENT SOLUTION**
    
    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import json
    import yaml

    sample = {
      "foo": "bar",
      "baz": [
        "qux",
        "quxx"
      ],
      "corge": None,
      "grault": 1,
      "garply": True,
      "waldo": "false",
      "fred": "undefined",
      "emptyArray": [],
      "emptyObject": {},
      "emptyString": ""
    }

    print 'Show me JSON:'
    print json.dumps(sample)

    ff = open('data.yml', 'wb')
    yaml.dump(sample, ff, default_flow_style=False)

    print 'Show me YAML:'
    print yaml.dump(sample, default_flow_style=False)
    ```

0. Save your current program as **/home/student/bin/jso2yam.py**

0. Back at the terminal, change permissions on your file.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `chmod u+x /home/student/bin/jso2yam.py`

0. Great. Now run your code.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `./jso2yam.py`

0. Your output should look like the screenshot below:

    ![JSON to YAML](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_json2yaml_01.png) 

0. Copy the output under the words "Show me YAML:" (*highlight, right-click, then select select copy*).

0. Within the remote desktop, use Firefox to open a tab to a YAML validator, like YAMLlint - http://www.yamllint.com

0. Paste the copied code into the the validator, then press **Validate**

0. The code should be successfully validated. Provided that it is, you can close this FireFox tab.

0. Now let's augment our code that that we read the input file from a target location, say, **/home/student/input.json**. Delete the line that begins **sample = {** and everything below it, down to (but not including) **ff = open('data.yml', 'wb')**. Your code should look like the screenshot below:

    ![Edited](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_json2yaml_04.png) 

0. Just below the line **ff = open('data.yml', 'wb')**, place the following line. This line uses the with statement and the **open()**. The **with** statement simplifies exception handling by encapsulating common preperation and cleanup tasks. In addition, it will automatically close the file. The statement below uses *fh* to refer to the file object input.json created by open().

    ```
    with open('/home/student/input.json') as fh:
    ```
0. On the next line, indent 4 spaces (no tabs), and use json.load() to read the file object fh.

    ```
        sample = json.load(fh)
    ```

0. To be clear, your code should now look like the code below.

    **CURRENT SOLUTION**
    
    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import json
    import yaml

    ff = open('data.yml', 'wb')
    with open('/home/student/input.json') as fh:
        sample = json.load(fh)
    
    yaml.dump(sample, ff, default_flow_style=False)

    print 'Show me YAML:'
    print yaml.dump(sample, default_flow_style=False)
    ```

0. Save your modified program as **/home/student/bin/jso2yam2.py**

0. Now we need to produce a JSON input file. For this, we'll use Wireshark. Wireshark is an industry standard tracing tool. If this is your first time using it, surf on over to http://wireshark.org and look around.

0. Open a new terminal session and change directory **/home/student**

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd`
    
0. Use the **wget** command to download a Wireshark *.pcap* trace file.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `wget https://alta3.com/static/images/python/ims_sip.pcap`

0. Once again, use the **wget** command to download another Wireshark *.pcap* trace file. *Note: this one has \_1.pcap at the end.*

    `student@beachhead:~$` `wget https://alta3.com/static/images/python/ims_sip_1.pcap`

0. After the file is downloaded, open it with Wireshark.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `wireshark ims_sip.pcap &`

0. This is an IMS trace file from a lab- however, it is almost identical to a production trace. This trace file contains only one protocol type, SIP. SIP is the glue that holds the IMS core together. It is the signaling set that connects two cellular devices at layer 7. Some people may have never seen a SIP trace file, so let's take a look at some SIP header information (i.e. the language of nearly all communication devices on the planet). 

0. Click on the first packet in the trace file.

0. Expand the subtree next to **Session Initiation Protocol (INVITE)**

0. Expand the subtree next to **Message Headers**

0. If you're lost, look at the screen shot below:

    ![Wireshark SIP](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_json2yaml_05.png)

0. Look for the header **Call-ID**. **Call-ID** is a constant value, it will not change as this message passes between two UAs (SIP endpoints... think cellphones). If you're lost, this is the *green star* in the screenshot.

0. Look for the header **Contact**. **Contact** *usually* reveals originator of the SIP message. Here we could say that Alice is making a call from extension 1021 at 192.168.30.152 on port 5060. If you're lost, this is the *yellow star* in the screenshot.

0. Look at the Request-Line, **INVITE sip:1022@two.ims SIP/2.0**. The first clue is that the first word is all caps, which is a distinguishing characteristic of a SIP request. The SIP URI, 1022@two.ims, is where we *think* this message is ultimately headed (the user 1022 within the domain of two.ims). Since this is a a new call, it's possible this information will be rewritten as the message is routed. The final piece of information, **SIP/2.0**, is the way every SIP request terminates its Request-Line. There is no other version. If you're lost, this is the *purple star* in the screenshot.

0. So we're not going to become SIP super-stars today, but hopefully that crash course has you understanding the type of information SIP transports and why it is critical to be able to parse SIP data for patterns. Unfortunately, this trace contains too much data for us to work with, so **close wireshark, and with it this trace file**.

0. Open Wireshark again. This time, use the second (and much smaller) of the two files we downloaded.

    `student@beachhead:~$` `wireshark ims_sip_1.pcap &`

0. Notice this file only has one SIP packet.

0. Now navigate to **File > Export Packet Dissections > As JSON...**

    ![As JSON](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_json2yaml_03.png)

0. Choose the target directory as **/home/student/** and save the file as **input.json**

0. Let's run our program and see if our JSON dumped from Wireshark was turned into YAML! Back at the terminal, change permissions on your file.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `chmod u+x /home/student/bin/jso2yam2.py`
    
0. Try running the new Python program.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `./jso2yam2.py`

0. Our YAML is printed to the screen, but it is also contained within **data.yml**. Open our new data set in leafpad.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `leafpad data.yml &`

0. Copy the output contained within **data.yml**, and confirm that it validates via an online tool like, YAMLlint - http://www.yamllint.com Using this tool should produce results like the screenshot shown below.

    ![Valid YAML](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_json2yaml_02.png)
   
0. Network people know, \*.pcap files are industry standard. They also know it can be a nightmare sifting through traces for patterns that reveal a story. Learning to manipulate trace captures is a powerful skill we're going to continue to build on. If you'd like to continue exploring concepts in this lab, here are some things to try:

    - Parse JSON or YAML for the contact header, and display the value
    - Parse JSON or YAML for the Call-ID header, and display the value
    - Build your own YAML or JSON validator tool
    - Try exporting a larger set of JSON data (more than a single packet), and converting it to YAML 
    - Wireshark can export data as CSV records, see if you can convert them to JSON or YAML

0. If you do attempt any of the challenges above, send the instructor your solution(s). We'll post them and give you credit.

0. That's it for this lab. Thanks!

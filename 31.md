# Lab 31 - Construct a SimpleHTTPServer and HTTP Client

### THURSDAY - &#x2B50;REQUIRED&#x2B50;

### Lab Objective

Let's start using our Python skills to play around with HTTP, Wireshark, and basic scripting of network services. Before we get started, review this documentation page on the Python 2.x SimpleHTTPServer: https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html

We'll also be using the Python 3.x http.client, so look over that documentation as well: https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html

### Procedure

0. Take a moment to clean up your remote Desktop. For now, close all other terminal spaces or windows you might have open.

0. Open a new terminal, then *cd* to the **/home/student/bin** directory:

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd /home/student/bin`

0. Our first goal is to launch an HTTP server. Start by opening leafpad.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `leafpad&`
    
0. Cool. Now copy and paste the code below (which was taken from the Python doc page on how to create a SimpleHTTPServer).

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import SimpleHTTPServer
    import SocketServer

    PORT = 9021

    Handler = SimpleHTTPServer.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler

    httpd = SocketServer.TCPServer(("", PORT), Handler)

    print "serving at port", PORT
    httpd.serve_forever()
    ```
    
0. Notice that we could start our server on any port we wanted. In the code above, we choose port 9021. Choose **File > Save As**

0. Save your code as **custom_server.py** in **/home/student/bin**.

0. Down in the terminal, change permissions on your script.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `chmod u+x custom_server.py`

0. Now run your code.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `./custom_server.py`

0. From within your remote desktop environment, open your browser, and head to: http://127.0.0.1:9021

0. You should see a **Directory listing for /** of the files from within **/home/student/bin**, since that is where we started the webservice from.

0. Wow, that was fast. You can let your code run. For now, let's open a new terminal window, and change to the **/home/student/bin** directory.

    `student@beachhead:/$` `cd /home/student/bin`

0. Now our goal is to create a client that can pull a file from our HTTP server. Start by opening leafpad.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `leafpad&`

0. First let's define a Python3 shebang line (we want our client to be a cool Python3.x client)

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    ```
    
0. Next, let's import the **http.client**

    ```
    import http.client
    ```


0. First let's define **conn** with the parameters of our server.

    ```
    conn = http.client.HTTPConnection("localhost", 9021)
    ```
    
0. Cool. Answer the following question before moving on.

    - **Q1: How did we know to write that line of code?**
      - A1: Check the page on use of http.client https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html
      
0. Okay. Next, let's issue a simple HTTP method, HEAD. HEAD never returns any data, but should give us an HTTP response from our webserver. The line below will manipulate conn by sending a HEAD message to the server we described, and then storing the response as an attribute within the **conn** object.

    ```
    conn.request('HEAD', '/')
    ```

0. Great. Now set **res** to **conn.getresponse()**, which returns just the response that has been associated with the **conn** object.

    ```
    res = conn.getresponse()
    ```

0. Now print the response status, and the reason to the screen.

    ```
    print(res.status, res.reason)
    ```
    
0. Choose **File > Save As**, and save the file as **eim.py** in **/home/student/bin/**

0. Down at the terminal, change the permissions on your file.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `chmod u+x eim.py`
    
0. Now execute your code.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `./eim.py`

0. Looks like we got a **200 OK** message back. Back to the script. Let's add some code below the lines we currently have. We'll try making a GET message, which should return the data assocaited with the root directory we're probing on (which should be listing within the directory).

    ```
    conn.request('GET', '/') # this time we'll issue GET
    res = conn.getresponse() # res is equal to the response associated wtih conn
    print(res.status, res.reason) # print the response status code and reason
    page_data = res.read()  # page_data is all of the data associated with res 
    print(page_data) # this will proint out all of the data assocaited with res
    ```

0. After you pasted the above code block into your script, choose **File > Save**

0. Execute your script.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `./eim.py`

0. Cool! Looks like we got a **200 OK** message from the head message, and a **200 OK** message from the get, along with some **HTML** page data. Very cool! Watch out Internet Explorer, here we come!

0. Why don't we stick Wireshark on this picture and watch our HTTP client run. Click the little Sharkfin shown in the screenshot below.

    ![Launch Wireshark](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_wireshark_001.png) 

0. Now double click on the interface any (see the screenshot below).

    ![any interface Wireshark](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_wireshark_002.png)
    
0. In the display filter at the top of the screen, type **http** *make sure you use lowercase*, and then hit enter. When you do, all packets should dissapear (except those that are type HTTP).

    ![http filter Wireshark](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_wireshark_003.png)
    
0. Now rerun your script.

    `student@beachhead:~/bin$` `./eim.py`
    
0. Back on Wireshark, press the red square **stop** button to stop capturing packets.

    ![stopping Wireshark](https://alta3.com/static/images/python/python_wireshark_004.png)
    
0. Now make the three clicks shown below to see the content of the **200 OK** HTTP message returned to our GET HTTP message. Make sure the connent is the same as that returned by our client, and that displayed on your webpage.

0. When you're done clicking around in Wireshark, you can close the application.

0. That's it for this lab. Some bonus objectives are listed below if you want to keep going. Otherwise, follow the remaining clean up steps and then move on to the next lab.

0. When you're done, close all of the terminals you have open (including the one running your webserver).

0. Close the Firefox tab open to **http://localhost:9021**

0. **Bonus Objective 01:** Upgrade your webclient so that a user can choose **1** to test a connection (send HTTP HEAD), or **2** to perform a GET.

0. **Bonus Objective 02:** Dump the data returned by the HTTP GET to a file called **http_readin.txt**
